Write a RandomGenerator class:

public class RandomGenerator {

	public RandomGenerator(int n) {
	}
	
	public int generate() {
		// todo
	}
}
The contructor will be passed an integer n. generate is supposed to return a random number between 0 to n, but it is not supposed to return a number that it has already returned. If possiblities are exhauted, return -1.

Example:

var rg = new RandomGenerator(3);
rg.generate(); // 0
rg.generate(); // 2
rg.generate(); // 1
rg.generate(); // -1



specific to rubrik: 
    when genrate has exchausted instead of -1, start over.
    also what if u extend the rg online, can u still give the ones u haven't given and also the new stuff?
