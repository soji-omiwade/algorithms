9:30 - 11: callbacks, 2 job applications, 
10 - 12: DFS for word ladder; bucket sort problem on pramp
12 - 4: multi-frac
    . cum+rate (need normalization for this)
        - error function: error should now be normalized: so we can take averages of the normal
            first: normalize cum and make sure u get what u should
            then repeat for rate
            then you can do the combo
    - add input on function: ms, rms, abs
