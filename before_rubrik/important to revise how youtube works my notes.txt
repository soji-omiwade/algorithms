why is the database swapping? it isn't using more memory than the system has? 

system memory: 5G
usage: app expected usage 4.5G


DB Optimizations:
- Query optimizations
- Batch jobs when doing something real time takes too long
- memcache to act as DB cache: a hash table listening on a TCP socket allows you to get and set data using a string based key

- watch out for replicas hurting from write-hog, and thus unable to serve reads
- also too many replicas. well now you have a single point of failure to worry about: if master needs to be replaced, all replicas need to be updated accordingly

having too many replicas is a symptom of a larger issue. you're not spreading the load evenly across machhines for example.

DB Cache priming: pre-fetch the pages you need!  (withh a cache thread reduce replica lag, if you have replica lag. 

DB RAID Tweaking (whew. wow. let Linux see 5 volumes instead of 1 logical volume), allowing it more aggresively schedlue disk i/o


Youtube lessons learned for me: 
-knowledge of using a CDN didn't save them (they didn't have the money)
-what saved them was knowledge of fundementals of CS
	. database sharding
	. DB caching
	. App server caching
	. tinkering with the RAID volume to parallelize DISK I/O
		- thx to checking iostat
	. Cache priming: pre-fetch the pages you need one thread braces the data for the slow single-threaded DB (this allows that to read fast)
fun and interesting stuff!
