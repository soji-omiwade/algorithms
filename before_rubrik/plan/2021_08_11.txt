• Relax:
+ Coding: 2 – 3 problems
    + K-th largest in sorted matrix problem (4)
    + In-memory file system (2?)
+ Systems design
    ◦ Think (numbers-wise) about why you go from .5 million -> 100 million, and you only add 3 machines. wow.
        ▪ well if your machine wasn’t really bogged down before then a BOE would probably agree
        ▪ also if you add other things that didn’t exist like CDN, dedicated cache, then horizontal instance scaling shouldn’t be stretched to infinity
        ▪ finally, the DB itself can use a Master/Slave (if it wasn’t already), or better yet, sharding/federating tables
        ▪ denormalization/NO-SQL can be explored (fast key-value lookup), but now you likely have consistency problems: multiple copies of the same field in
            • the normalized form
            • at least one copy in the de-normalized form (where the originally foreign key id would have been)
tonight: 
    + architeching systems for scale
    + Something later tonight (randomized set) : not randomized set: just kinda why create-heap is O(n)

Friday:
    • KPI for Theo
