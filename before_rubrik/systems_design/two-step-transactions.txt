two-step transactions to help with denormalized federated shards
    1. open transaction on shard1: then write commands
    2. open transaction on shard2; then write commands
    3. commit on shard1
    4. if first commit ok, commit on shard2 (can still cause inconsistency if box2 goes down after the commit)
