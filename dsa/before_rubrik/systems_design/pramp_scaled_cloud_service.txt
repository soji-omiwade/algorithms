scope
------
generally needed features for a web-service

out-of-scope
-------------
specific app features




high-level design
------------------
start with a small number of user
and then scale

DNS - 
  - LOAD BALANCE web servers --

  1 - 3 nginx or apache on compute nodes

  - requirement - compute node- autoscale
  - 12 - 25x compute nodes for the business logic  ---compute
  
 auto scaling metirc
 -HADOOP analytics at end of day from web server logs
 -traffic monitoring determine your autoscaling
 
 monitoring
 
 compute-nodes and webserver nodes
  deploy code changes - managed service across all node instances
  
  globally spread nodes
  
  databases
    -SQL
      -PostGreSQL
        - Master to Master config
          - Streaming Replication - 
        - Master to slaves .. bottlenecked
        - horiz. scale: 
            scale 
              *consistent* hashing
          
 not mention
  - notification service
  - message queing
  - https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer
  
  code
    version-controlled
    Git - on/offline is good

    hosting of the code itself ...

    deployment apps
    -----------
    jenkins, circleci,
