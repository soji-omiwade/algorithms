engineering:
    sometimes we build great software
    othertimes we don't
        - fragile: little edits break them
        - immobile: reuse is difficult
        - viscous: hard to do extend/do the right thing/platform from

planning is integral to good software and process
    understand the problem
    plan a solution
    carry out the plan
    examine your results for accuracy
        
building is fun, yeah, but we have work to do! the fun will come. don't worry

    put users first
    add value
    act as a leader
    assume positive intent
    iron sharpens iron

do this all the time:
    consistency

    You aint gonna need it
    dont repeat yourself
    leave it better than when you found it
    write readable code
    
ship early, ship often
    -be proud of your code. don't ship stuff if you think it's crap
    -how will this  break? not will it
    -it will fail one day. will it bring everything else down
    -continuous deployment
    -have
