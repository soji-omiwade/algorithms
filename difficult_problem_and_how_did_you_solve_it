- Difficult problem & how did you solve it: speak to your PhD
	. claim a conjecture holds and go about proving it
		- this was for my doctoral thesis. 
		- blank board. then step by step:
			- chiefly divide and conquer. 
			- debug the theory (unit-test)
			- merge if possible the cases for a simple solution
		- QA: hand it over to collaborators, who look at it and suggest edits (not necessarily bugs; but "performance improvements)
